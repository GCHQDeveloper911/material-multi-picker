If you want to integrate the picker into a form and you're using the [Redux Form library](https://redux-form.com), you can integrate it as you would any other field. The demo below uses [field-level validation](https://redux-form.com/8.1.0/examples/fieldlevelvalidation/) to replace the helpertext with a custom error message if you enter more than 3 fruit. Note that because Redux Form doesn't supply its initial values immediately, you may get console errors informing you that you've been passed an empty string.
